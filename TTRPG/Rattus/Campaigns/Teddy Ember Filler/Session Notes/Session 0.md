We're on a boat headed to [[Vepha]], heard tales of lands full of adventures and gold. Heard many tales of the land being filled with dangerous monsters and pirates. It's a couple day journey from the Sword Coast, we are landing at the port city of [[Ukthad]].

We took a mission to find missing campers close to [[Ukthad]], about a day's walk north. Henny, the owner of the Red Flail in Ukthad posted this mission. He is the town sheriff. There's a rumor you're not supposed to go up towards those mountains. It's dangerous, lots of people get lost up there. 60 gold if we return with proof of what happened, or with the campers. If we do it in 3 days will get 1 small item. Roger is getting a scimitar. Bjorn is getting a "free" cast of Find Familiar.

Dangerous mission, high amount of gold, in Simor
Keford, Scobury are towns that might have more adventures

We discovered the campers were waylaid by some bandits in the mountains. We killed 1 of them but we discovered where their camp is. There are 3 humans and a dog at the camp.
