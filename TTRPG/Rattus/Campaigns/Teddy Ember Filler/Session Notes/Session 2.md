## Events
We spent the night in Ukthad and set out to Mabraycig.
The ship ride between Ukthad and Mabraycig is 1 gold piece each and takes 2 hours. THERE IS NO MEAL INCLUDED WITH FARE.
Obtained an absolutely massive fish, brought it on the boat with us.
We acquired our adventurer's license under the name of the Fishsticks.
We got a job to steal a crate that contained a vase from dock #2, we successfully pulled it off (although Light and Roger got seen by a dockhand but managed to talk their way out) Received 30 gold as a reward.
We can turn in any adventurer's guild job at any outpost of the Adventurer's Guild
We headed out to Hastow early in the day, around 11 am.

## Locations
- Maybraycig City Hall
	- Adventure's Guild and other licenses on level 4
- The May Inn
- 3rd street, was told to avoid that street by some dockhands, sounds like there's a bunch of crime/drugs
