The GameMaker **Garbage Collector** exists because methods can be passed on the stack and left unreferenced, as can structs and a few other things, which in turn would cause a memory leak if they weren't "cleaned up" in some way. This is where the garbage collector comes in and it will run in the background of the game, collecting anything that's been de-referenced and maintaining an optimal memory usage. When we talk about something being de-referenced, we generally refer to any struct or function which isn't connected (it doesn't have to be directly, but through a chain of other variables) to a **global** variable or an **object instance variable**. Also note that functions defined in scripts in the IDE are also not collected, as they are implicitly made global.

>Please note that things like surfaces, data structures, buffers and other dynamic resources are **not** garbage collected and have their own destroy functions to clean up the memory associated with them. As a rule of thumb, if anything you create at run time has a destroy function then it won't be garbage collected and you will have to deal with it yourself in code. The exceptions to this are sequences, animation curves and instances, which also require the garbage collector, **but still need to have their destroy function called**.
